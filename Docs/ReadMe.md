2. The spreadsheet outputs: Value, Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Phi (rate of 
change of value with respect to change of foreign interest rate), Rho (rate of 
change of value with respect to change of domestic interest rate) of the call 
option

3. The user can select two Greeks from the list of the Greeks above (Greek1 and 
Greek2), the starting spot, the end spot and the number of spots between the 
start and end value. Then, at the press of a button, the spreadsheet gives:
    (a) The spot-Greek1 graph
    (b) The spot-Greek2 graph
    (c) The Greek1-Greek2 graph
